    }
  }
}
```

### Adding to Claude Desktop

**Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openalex-author-disambiguation": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/Users/jabreu/PycharmProjects/author-disambiguation-mcp/openalex_author_disambiguation.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Career Stage Analysis

The server provides sophisticated career stage analysis:

### Career Stages
- **Very Early Career**: < 5 publications
- **Early Career (First Author Focus)**: > 60% first author papers
- **Mid-Career (Leadership Role)**: > 40% last author papers
- **Senior Researcher**: High last-author ratio + H-index > 15
- **Established Researcher**: High seniority score (> 0.6)
- **Experienced Researcher**: > 20 publications with mixed patterns

### Seniority Scoring
- **First author papers**: Weight = 0.2 (typically junior researchers)
- **Middle author papers**: Weight = 0.5 (collaboration/contribution)
- **Last author papers**: Weight = 1.0 (typically senior/PI role)

Formula: `(first √ó 0.2 + middle √ó 0.5 + last √ó 1.0) / total_papers`

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Agentic AI Systems
```python
# Get multiple candidates for AI decision-making
result = await server.disambiguate_author(
    name="John Smith",
    research_field="machine learning",
    max_candidates=5
)

# AI can analyze all candidates and select based on:
# - Confidence scores
# - Career stage appropriateness
# - Research topic alignment
# - Institutional context
```

### For Research Analysis
```python
# Analyze career progression
profile = await server.get_author_by_id("A5023888391")
print(f"Career span: {profile.career_length} years")
print(f"Evolution: {profile.career_stage}")
print(f"Leadership transition: {profile.seniority_score}")
```

### For Institution Mapping
```python
# Find authors by institution and field
authors = await server.search_authors(
    name="",  # Search all
    affiliation="Stanford University",
    research_field="artificial intelligence",
    limit=25
)
```
